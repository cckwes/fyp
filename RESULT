all using displacement step of 1m


0th strategy, full throttle
-full throttle everywhere
graph of power vs distance										0_0				v
graph of speed and gradient vs distance									0_1				v
power and gradient vs distance										0_2				v
graph of drag vs distance										0_3				v


1st preset strategy
-full throttle uphill, cruise downhill
graph of power vs distance										1_0				v
graph of speed and gradient vs distance									1_1				v
power and gradient vs distance										1_2				v
graph of drag vs distance										1_3				v


2nd preset strategy
-full throttle when uphill, less than 16m/s speed and less than 2650m(final straight)
graph of power vs distance										2_0				v
graph of speed and gradient vs distance									2_1				v
power and gradient vs distance										2_2				v
graph of drag vs distance										2_3				v


3rd preset strategy
-if at a flat road, the strategy limits the speed within 11-19m/s, except for journey after 2750m which cruises
-if uphill, the car will maintain at constant speed
-if downhill, cruise
graph of power vs distance										3_0
graph of speed and gradient vs distance									3_1
power and gradient vs distance										3_2
graph of drag vs distance										3_3
