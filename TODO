-introduction
	*introduction to PMBLDC
		** components in PMBLDC
		** how it works
		** ac signal
	*introduction to shell eco marathon (Problem Statement)
		** how it works, rules, distance, spec
	*objectives
		** tapping the signal from the proprietary system
		** develop the apparatus for measuring the motor performance
		** propose a method for improving the efficiency through reducing the cogging torque? by altering the hall effect sensor signal
		** improving the mileage of the electric vehicle by tuning Cd
	*scope of research
		** the power output and torque curve of the electric motor
		** investigate the composition signal/pin of the PMBLDC
		** study the track profile of the Sepang International North Track 
		** compose a set of strategy for enhancing the mileage
		** changes to the Cd, how and why? Retest, get the data for mileage improvement investigation
		
-methodology
	*tapping the signal of the controller
		** use what tool (multimeter)
		** show the controller board photo, describe the photo, the port
		** show the theory of hall effect sensor, signal for ex: analog/digital theory and then say how to find the signal using the theory
	*building the measurement system for measuring vehicle performance
		** show arduino
		** show how it works, the spec of it
		** show the theory, Pinput, Poutput and state why need those measurement
		**calibrate the system
	**develop the simulation
		** show the theory of Cd, Crr and all those forces
		** show the formulas
		** show the track profile
		** show the strategy, full throttle, cruise, and etc

-result and discussion
	*signal identification
	      ** identify ground by testing each of the 16 points against 15 other points while motor is static
	      ** test the ground against the other 15 pins for identifying the battery voltage and supply voltage
	      ** repeat the above procedure for unidentified ground by rev up the motor
	      ** discuss why the identified port is the correct port
	*measurement system
	      ** draw the schematic of the whole system
	      ** discuss why selected components are used
	*simulation
	      ** show simulation result for full throttle
	      ** discuss the trend??
	*strategies
	      ** show simulation result for several strategies
	      ** show improvement
	      ** discuss improvement, why and how
