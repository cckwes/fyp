\chapter{Acknowledgements}

First of all, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my final year project supervisor, Prof. Horizon Walker Gitano-Briggs for his valuable guidance and supervision throughout the course of this project. He had spent a lot of his valuable time in providing technical guidance and consultation on my final year project.

Next, I would like to thank the staff of School of Mechanical Engineering for providing equipment and material for building the vehilce and testing equipment for my final year project.

In additional, I would like to thank Lab Rants for preparing the \LaTeX template for this thesis which makes the thesis formatting neat and easy.

Last but not least, I would like to note my appreciation to my friends especially Chan Sai Mun and Leong Hong You for providing some great ideas and discussions during my progress through my final year project.
