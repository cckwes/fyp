-introduction
	*introduction to PMBLDC
		** components in PMBLDC
		** how it works
		** ac signal
	*introduction to shell eco marathon (Problem Statement)
		** how it works, rules, distance, spec
	*objectives
		** tapping the signal from the proprietary system
		** develop the apparatus for measuring the motor performance
		** propose a method for improving the efficiency through reducing the cogging torque? by altering the hall effect sensor signal
		** improving the mileage of the electric vehicle by tuning Cd
	*scope of research
		** the power output and torque curve of the electric motor
		** investigate the composition signal/pin of the PMBLDC
		** study the track profile of the Sepang International North Track 
		** compose a set of strategy for enhancing the mileage
		** changes to the Cd, how and why? Retest, get the data for mileage improvement investigation
		
-methodology
	*tapping the signal of the controller
		** use what tool (multimeter)
		** show the controller board photo, describe the photo, the port
		** show the theory of hall effect sensor, signal for ex: analog/digital theory and then say how to find the signal using the theory
	*building the measurement system for measuring vehicle performance
		** show arduino
		** show how it works, the spec of it
		** show the theory, Pinput, Poutput and state why need those measurement
	**develop the simulation
		** show the theory of Cd, Crr and all those forces
		** show the formulas
		** show the track profile
		** show the strategy, full throttle, cruise, and etc
