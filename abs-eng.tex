In Shell Eco-Marathon Urban Concept Category, a car that is similar to the on-road vehicle is built. Depending on the participation categrory, which is this case is the plug-in electric vehicle, electric motor is used as the power train of the electric vehicle. The power train for our electric vehicle consists of controller and a direct drive hub motor, both of the two components are proprietary and opening up of the components are restricted due to sponsorship issue. Therefore, the output signal from the controller which are the voltage and speed signal is identified for building a measurement system which would be used to measure, log and display the parameters. The measurement system is built using the Arduino microcontroller, ITDB02 display shield with SD card and ITDB02-3.2WC LCD screen for display. Apart from the measurement system for gathering the data, vehicle dynamics simulation software that is capable of simulate the rolling resistance, drag force, up/down the slope and driving and accelerating through Sepang North Track is built. Four strategies for driving the car around the circuit has been built aiming for the best mileage.
